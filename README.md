# SoC-FPGA-Projects

A little repository showcasing some simple projects made mainly for fun and a bit of learning, 
working on low-level programming, Embedded SW, HDL RTL code, FPGA design and workflow and some hands on breadboard prototyping.

FPGA is the Digilent Cora Z7, a Zynq-7000 based ARM/FPGA SoC - Xilinx Vivado & Vitis workflow.
